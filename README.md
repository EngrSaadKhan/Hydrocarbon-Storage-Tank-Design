## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project focuses on the **design of 6000 tons hydrocarbon storage tanks** (3000 tons Petrol + 3000 tons Diesel) along with a **loading and unloading system**. The design strictly follows **OGRA (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority of Pakistan)** rules and **API 650** standards.  

The project ensures:
- Compliance with national safety regulations  
- Efficient hydraulics using **Korf software**  
- Tank design using **AME-Tank** (as per API-650)  
- Structural design with **STAAD.Pro**  
- Layout & flow diagrams with **AutoCAD**  
- Fire protection and safety systems  

## ðŸ›  Methodology
- Land feasibility and sizing as per OGRA requirements  
- Plot plan and PFD development  
- Tank sizing iterations with API-650  
- Hydraulic calculations (Pipe + Pump sizing)  
- Pump selection & performance validation  
- Gantry structural design  
- Firefighting and foam system design
